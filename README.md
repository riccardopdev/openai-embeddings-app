# NodeJS app for openai API Embeddings
This is a NodeJS app that uses the openai API to implement embeddings by reading data from local files (.csv), calling the openai embeddings API and writing the results to a new file.  
  
Openaiâ€™s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings.  
An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness.
